# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
As a new employee at Pyber, V. Isualize has given Omar and me an assignment to use our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
## Results
When comparing the data from Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities, the summary data frame below shows that urban cities generate considerably more revenue because of the higher volume of rides when compared to urban and rural cities.  On the other hand, suburban and rural cities averaged higher in the price per ride and the fare per driver.
