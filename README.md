# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
As a new employee at Pyber, V. Isualize has given Omar and me an assignment to use our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
## Results
When comparing the data from Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities, the summary data frame below shows that urban cities generate considerably more revenue because of the higher volume of rides when compared to urban and rural cities.  On the other hand, suburban and rural cities averaged higher in the price per ride and the fare per driver.

Next, when comparing Urban, Suburban, and Rural fares across dates between January and April, 2019, the following line chart was created.

This image shows how total fares fluctuated across the four months, with a consistent peak in all three fares in the second half of February.  

## Summary
Based on the results, three business recommendations to the CEO regarding disparities among the city types include the following:
### Recommendation 1
If there is a difference in pricing between urban cities and the other two, a price adjustment to suburban and rural cities to a lower price for a ride could improve the volume of business for the company in these markets.
### Recommendation 2
If this data of fares is consistent across multiple years, a sale or incentive for rides could generate more business in times when fewer rides are being taken. 
### Recommendation 3
Since the data does not show a single span of dates in which all three markets show a consistent dip in fares (except very briefly before the peak in late February), the sales or incentives should be localized to the markets that show a dip in fares rather than across all three markets at the same time.
