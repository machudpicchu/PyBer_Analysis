# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
As a new employee at Pyber, V. Isualize has given Omar and me an assignment to use our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
